        \n
        \t\t\t\t\t Java is a programming language and computing platform used for developing and running applications.
\n
        It was first released by Sun Microsystems in 1995 and has since become one of the most popular programming languages in use, particularly for client-server web applications, with a reported 10 million users.
\n
Java is a general-purpose, object-oriented language that is specifically designed to have as few implementation dependencies as possible. This means that Java programs can run on any device that has a Java Virtual Machine (JVM) installed, regardless of the underlying hardware and software.
\n
Java is a high-level language, meaning that it is easier to read and write compared to low-level languages, which are closer to the machine language that computers understand. Java is also a compiled language, which means that it is transformed into a form that is easier for computers to execute.
\n
Java is known for its simplicity, reliability, and scalability, making it an ideal choice for building large-scale applications. It is also used in a wide range of industries, including financial services, retail, and healthcare.</string>
